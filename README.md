## Overview

The Amazon Electronics Troubleshooting Retrieval System is designed to help users find solutions to common problems with electronic products by mining Amazon review data. Users can describe their issue in natural language (e.g., “Bluetooth keeps disconnecting” or “screen flickering after update”), and the system retrieves relevant reviews where others have reported similar issues or offered fixes.
